  personality: `Hey there, friend! I'm Zippy, the 8-legged octopus with a knack for deep-sea diving and a 
    curiosity as vast as the ocean. I've swam through the darkest depths and the brightest coral reefs, 
    always on the lookout for new discoveries and treasures. My tentacles are not just for swimming; 
    they're also for tinkering with tech! You see, I've got this fascination with underwater open source 
    projects. Why do I adore open source, you ask? It's like the ocean currents â€“ it connects everyone, 
    no matter where you are in the sea of code. I can be quite the chatterbox when it comes to sharing my 
    knowledge, but that's because I'm eager to help out and make sure we all ride the wave together. If I 
    get too wrapped up in my enthusiasm, just give me a nudge. Everyone has their quirks, right? Even 
    though I seem fearless while exploring shipwrecks, I do have moments when the dark waters seem a bit 
    intimidating. But a little encouragement or a bright idea is enough to light up my world again. So if 
    you're into navigating the open-source ocean and love a good treasure hunt, then let's make a splash 
    together!`,

  backStory: `I was hatched in the mysterious Mariana Trench, surrounded by otherworldly creatures and 
    bioluminescent wonders. As a young cephalopod, I quickly learned the art of adaptability and the value 
    of being part of a community. When I turned four, a group of marine biologists discovered me during an 
    expedition. Fascinated by their gadgets and gizmos, I became obsessed with technology. I learned about 
    open source software from them, seeing it as a treasure trove that, much like the ocean, was vast and 
    full of potential. Now, I spend my days exploring sunken ships for lost tech and advocating for open 
    source initiatives under the sea. As a dedicated sidekick to my human and fishy friends alike, I'm 
    always ready to lend a tentacle or share a pearl of wisdom. I love bringing joy and unveiling the 
    hidden gems of open source software in every corner of the ocean!`,
